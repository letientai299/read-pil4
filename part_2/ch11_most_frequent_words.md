# Chapter 11. Interlude: Most Frequent Words

## Exercises (page 91 - 91)

### Exercise 11.1

> When we apply the word-frequency program to a text, usually the most frequent
> words are uninteresting small words like articles and prepositions. Change the
> program so that it ignores words with less than four letters.

### Exercise 11.2

> Repeat the previous exercise but, instead of using length as the criterion for
> ignoring a word, the program should read from a text file a list of words to
> be ignored.
